# Welcome to BackWind RedM Server Project!
I'm excited to share my first public RedM server repository on GitHub with the community! I have just started creating this repository, and it will take some time to build a fully functional server. But I hope that this repository will provide a valuable resource for those who are interested in Red Dead Redemption 2 roleplaying.

## Features
### This repository will eventually include a variety of features, such as:

- Custom player models and clothing items
- Dynamic weather and time-of-day systems
- Vehicle spawning and handling scripts
- Jobs and activities, such as hunting and mining
- Inventory and crafting systems
- Chat and emote commands
- Admin tools for managing the server and players

### Please note that not all of these features are available yet.
